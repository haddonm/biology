Description: Aids in fitting growth curves to invertebrate tagging data, 
    particularly the Inverse Logistic, but also the dose-response curve and the
    Michaelis-Menton curve. In addition, it faciliatates fitting maturity-at- 
    size/age curves using Binomial residual errors to invertebrate maturity data.
